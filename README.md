# -Adversarial-Attacks-on-Face-Recognition-in-Airport-Security-Systems
This repository demonstrates a PGD adversarial attack on facial recognition systems, using the FaceNet model. It includes a Streamlit interface for visualizing original and adversarial images, assessing how perturbations can mislead facial recognition algorithms in high-security environments.
